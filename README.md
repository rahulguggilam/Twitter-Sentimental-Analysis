# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** that can analyze text data and classify it based on sentiment (e.g., positive or negative). The entire workflow is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `sentimental.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation  
- `README.md` — Documentation for the project  

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and preprocess text data for machine learning  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets with reproducibility  
- Train machine learning models for sentiment classification  
- Evaluate the models using accuracy and other metrics  

## 🚀 Features
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization)  
- Stratified train/test split to preserve label distribution  
- Training with classifiers such as Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes  
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

## 🛠️ Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
```

Inside Jupyter Notebook, install dependencies if required:

```bash
!pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter

```
